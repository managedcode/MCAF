MCAF is an open framework built by developers who believe AI coding agents need structure, not just prompts.
This page recognizes the people who made it happen.

## Special Thanks

- **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-johansson-4a4bb61/" target="_blank">Roger Johansson</a>** — His post about self-learning code agents inspired the self-learning logic that became the core of MCAF
- **<a href="https://agentskills.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agent Skills</a>** — We’re grateful for this open specification (originally developed by Anthropic) that made “skills” concrete: file-based packaging, progressive disclosure, and practical integration patterns
- **<a href="https://agents.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AGENTS.md</a>** — Thank you for standardizing the idea of a repository-native instruction file; this is a critical foundation for how MCAF treats agent rules as versioned, reviewable code
